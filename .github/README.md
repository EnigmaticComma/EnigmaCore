Enigma Core for Unity - is a useful set of tools and extensions to speedup development of core Unity applications. This code is shared between all my projects and it is in active update and improvement.

It's being used in my main current game project "[Resultarias](https://chrisjogos.com/resultarias)", a surrealist game about dream exploration.
